Hand Gesture Volume Control
This project uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control system volume. The application leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw to detect hand movements and adjust the system's audio volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

Features
Real-time hand gesture tracking using MediaPipe.
System volume control with Pycaw based on hand gestures.
Visual indicators on the video feed to show volume level.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy
Pycaw
Comtypes
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-volume-control.git
cd hand-gesture-volume-control
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw comtypes
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python volume_control.py
Adjust the system volume:

Use the thumb and index finger to create a pinching gesture.
Move your fingers closer to decrease the volume and further apart to increase it.
The volume percentage and a visual bar will be displayed on the video feed.
Exit the application:

Press the spacebar to stop the application and close the camera feed.
Code Overview
volume_control.py: Main script that captures video from the camera, processes hand gestures, and controls the system volume.
